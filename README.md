## OpenGJKSharp
OpenGJKSharp is a C# native implementation of the GJK (Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi) algorithm, designed for efficient collision detection between convex polyhedra in 3D space.
This project is inspired by the original [openGJK](https://github.com/MattiaMontanari/openGJK) (written in C) and reimagined for the .NET ecosystem.
